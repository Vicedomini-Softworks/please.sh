# please.sh

**A sudo wrapper that asks permission first (from you, to your terminal)**

---

## 🙏 What is this?

`please` is a shell function that makes your terminal more polite. Instead of just running `sudo command`, you now run `please command` and your terminal will:

1. Say "🙏 asking nicely..." before running your command
2. Say "✨ success!" if it works
3. Say "❌ that didn't work" if it fails (with helpful tips)

It's sudo, but with manners.

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Instead of this:
sudo apt update

# Do this:
please apt update

# Output:
# 🙏 asking nicely...
# [sudo] password for you:
# ... command runs ...
# ✨ success!
```

## 🎯 Why would I use this?

- **Friendly vibes**: Your terminal should be nice to you
- **Clear feedback**: You always know if something worked or not
- **Zero learning curve**: Just type `please` instead of `sudo`
- **Meme potential**: Tell your friends you "ask nicely" before running sudo commands
- **Lightweight**: It's 28 lines of bash. That's it.

## 🤔 How does it work?

It's literally just a shell function:

```bash
please() {
  echo "🙏 asking nicely..."
  sudo "$@"
  # ... friendly feedback ...
}
```

The `"$@"` preserves all your arguments, so `please apt update` becomes `sudo apt update` under the hood.

## 🛠️ Customization

Want to change the messages? Edit `~/.please.sh`:

```bash
# Make it sassier
please() {
  [ $# -eq 0 ] && echo "🙄 I need a command, genius" && return 1
  echo "🥺 *puppy eyes* Running with sudo..."
  sudo "$@" && echo "🎉 you're welcome" || echo "💀 oopsie"
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Q: `please: command not found`**
A: Make sure you sourced the script or restarted your shell

**Q: Still asking for password every time**
A: That's sudo's behavior, not `please`. Configure `/etc/sudoers` if you want passwordless sudo

**Q: Can I use this with fish/zsh/bash?**
A: Yes! It works in any POSIX shell that supports functions
